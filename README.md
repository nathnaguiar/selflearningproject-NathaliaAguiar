# Funny Day – React + Vite

This project is a self-learning exercise built using React and Vite.  
It’s a simple and responsive web app that displays random facts using three different public APIs.

The design is colorful, accessible, and responsive, featuring cards that fetch:

- 🐱 Cat facts from `https://catfact.ninja/fact`
